## Summary

Anchors match strings in specific places such as the beginning or end of the string or end of a line.

## Anchor Components
Assert something about the string or the matching process
the ^(caret) is the start of the sting and the $(dollar) is the match at the very end of the string

The monday portion shows a bit of how the anchors work that the ^M and ^m logs show that its looking at the beginning to see if its capitalized or not.
While the y$ and a$ is looking at the end of the sting to match to see which is matching.
